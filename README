"Weird Infinity"
A Tiger Compiler 

This is the companion to our Tiger compiler. We wrote 
our compiler in Haskell - this gave some nice benefits and presented 
some interesting challenges. 

Certain segments of the compiler became more difficult to program 
through our use of Haskell. For example, we created unique identifiers 
for all variables by keeping a counter and incrementing it each time we 
encountered new bindings. Yet, state and mutation don't exist in 
Haskell, so we couldn't mutate variables, which was a problem since we 
browsed the abstract syntax tree depth-first. We would often have to pass the tree 
around, making certain computations slow and laborious. In addition, it made some features of
Tiger such as recursive types extremely difficult. It forced us to implement
a full unification algorithm to determine the types without using mutation.

Some advantages afforded by Haskell include instances of pattern matching. Codegen
was made much easier by the fact that we could pattern match on types of code. In addition,
certain long strings of operations were made much easier by Haskell's composability.

Our representation of registers and memory in IR was a unique approach. We represented memory
using the "Mem" or "MemOffset" data types. We thought this was an interesting strategy because
it allowed us to represent operations on memory as arbitrarily as possible. This means that 
our IR is very portable.

The implementation of this strategy can be seen in moveToVal and moveToReg, two functions
which represent moving arbitrary data in memory to registers, and vice-versa. This is
an abstraction over the idea of operations on memory. The way they work is by representing
memory locations are relative, and actually determining them as we 
generate code.

Haskell's functional purity was a curse and its pattern patching a blessing.
